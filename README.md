# Shape-Detection-and-Allignment

### `This is the project of Computer Vision and Image Processing.`

### `OBJECTIVE:`

From the given image below, We need to numbered rectangle according to the length of line within that rectangle.

Rectangle consisting of line with smallest length should be assigned as 1 and 2, 3 and so on in ascending order.

In this project, I have used my own logics to number and allign lines and rectangles.

I 've documented my logics in pdf files which i have uploaded in this repo.

For `detailed documentation` of this task, check pdf files that i ve uploaded above.

### `TIPS TO START THIS PROJECT:`

i) Download zip file and extract and open in Pycharm.

ii) Make sure to install package using `pip install opencv-python` from pycharm terminal or `directly from pycharm.

iii) Start with `rectangle_numbering.py` and open pdf `rectangle_numbering-detailedDocumentation.pdf` in another window.

iv) Go through pdf first and also visting part of codes that you ve read in timely fashion.

v) Then Proceed with similar approach to `rectangle_allignment.py`.

I could use `cv2.warpAffine()` to rotate whole contours along with its child.

But, as a learner, I loved to use my own logics and put into code which i ve done here in this project.

Thanks for Visiting.
